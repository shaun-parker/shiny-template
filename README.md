# shiny-template

Branded R Shiny template for new projects. The project utilises the shinydashboard framework and applies some CSS formatting via the html file in the www folder. 

Run the app.R file to see the app template - you should see something like the below. The app in the template is a simple Monte Carlo roulette simulator, which shows a general net loss the more games played.
